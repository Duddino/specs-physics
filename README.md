# specs-physics

**specs-physics** aims to be an easily usable and extendable [nphysics](https://www.nphysics.org/) physics engine integration for applications and games that utilise the [Specs ECS](https://slide-rs.github.io/specs/).

The dream is to *simply* create `Entity`s with a set of configurable `Component`s and have most of your physics covered, be it collision/proximity detection, velocity and acceleration or gravity.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
specs-physics = "0.0.1"
```

## Acknowledgments

This project is heavily inspired by [nphysics-ecs-dumb](https://github.com/distransient/nphysics-ecs-dumb); they did most of the heavy lifting, I'm just building up on what they have started!
